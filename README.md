# 🏡 Real Estate Portfolio & Deal Viability Dashboard

A simple, modern **React + TypeScript** dashboard built to help property analysts and investors visualise deal data in one clean view.

This project was designed by **Josue Nganmoue** to demonstrate how property metrics — like total units, deal count, and portfolio value — can be tracked and filtered using a responsive web app.

## 🌟 What This Dashboard Does

This app acts as a mini “real estate command center.”  
You can quickly:

- 🏗 Filter projects by **status**, **property type**, or **location**  
- 💰 View totals for **deals**, **units**, and **portfolio value**  
- 📊 Switch between different dashboard sections (Overview, Pipeline, Data Management)  
- ⚡ Run it locally or deploy online using GitHub Pages or Vercel

🎯 Why I Built It
I created this as a property analytics demo to show how real-estate data can be made visual and interactive.
It’s part of my Business Analyst Portfolio, where I explore practical ways to present viability metrics and decision-support data through code.
